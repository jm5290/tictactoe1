This is a game of tic-tac-toe created using Python language.
It implements use of 2D arrays, as well as concepts like global and local variables, functions and loops.
Play the game by entering the coordinates to place your X or O
  - The coordinates range are in the range of 0,1,2.
  - Placing a token (X or O) in a place where there is already token will result in an error (made using a simple while loop)
Enjoy
